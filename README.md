## Benchmarking Path Finding Algorithms for DRGTK

The Greedy algorithm was extracted from the [DRGTK Examples](http://docs.dragonruby.org/#----path-finding-algorithms---heuristic-with-walls---main-rb). Merge sort was taken from the [Merge Sort in Ruby](https://medium.com/@allegranzia/merge-sort-in-ruby-102b750af287) by Alessandro Allegranzi. Both have been modified for performance.

## Running

Clone this repo into your DragonRuby directory and then run `./dragonruby dr-path-bench`. Requires at least DragonRuby 2.19 for the benchmarking functions.
